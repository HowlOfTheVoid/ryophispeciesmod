  "description" : "A species of snake-people who love to learn everything- From other species, to new skills and practices! They breathe thermal energy, and exhale cool steam through gaps in their scales- A whole new meaning to the term \"Cold-Blooded\"!\n\n[url=https://toyhou.se/23110595.ryophi] Toyhouse / More Info Here! [/url]\n\nIncludes the ability to spawn this species as NPCs, and a couple of outfits for the creatures!\n\nThe hopes with this mod is to implement a species of snakes that are slightly larger than most other player characters- Being about 3 blocks wide! It offers a little bit more challenge to gameplay, but doesn't actually block any progress on story missions. \n\nSet out as a wonder-driven snake, ready to master anything they can get their hands on!\n\nNOTE: The Ryophi are a species I've made, but I want to also encourage anyone interested to make their own characters based off the species! I love hearing about creative ideas regarding the things I make, and it'd be awesome to see the species grow and develop for others as well! The Toyhou.se link will also be used with artists permission to keep a record of any art of Ryophi characters!",
