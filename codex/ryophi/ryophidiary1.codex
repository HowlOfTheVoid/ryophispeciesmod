"It's too wet here. I should have gotten the dehumidifier nanos--

I feel stiff. My body's cold is freezing the water in my breath vents.

It's suffocating, and it feels like my whole body's turning to ice and stone.

I'm going to rest here for a bit. I hope that the warmth will melt the ice, and I can shake it off before it gets worse."
