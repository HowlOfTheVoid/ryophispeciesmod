"In my travels, I've come across a lot of different cultures, and variants on those cultures. I'm writing this to document those encounters and provide more information to those seeking it, on the small cultural differences between species.

It is my hope that, with these examples and the extensive information provided, that we as species can learn to grow from one another in this vast universe.",

"HUMANS:

Humans, like Ryophi, seem to be a strong cultural melting pot of people; However, it is notable that, unlike Ryophi, Humans have come to more embrace their differences as a source of honor and dignity.

In fact, you can often count on humans to find and seek out differences in others- Some are even known to incite controversy for the sake of it.

Sometimes this is for the sake of healthy debate- After all, social systems as diverse as the galaxy's can't flourish without engaging with others- But in cases such as the Occassus Cult, it can escalate into violence and hostility.

Humans' sense of growing in diverse environments is made no less significant by their founding of the Terran Protectorate, that welcomes in all kinds of species from across the galaxy.",

"HYOLOTL:

Hyolotl culture is largely centered around knowledge and beauty- The powers to interpret the world, and to make the world worth more to interpret.

This makes Hyolotl structures and settlements a centerpiece of any planet- A location of beauty and highly-refined artistry, but this does come at a limitation;

By focusing on their own ideals of 'Perfection,' Hyolotl culture has closed their eyes to the beauty of a collage.

The species tends to view others' cultures as somewhat inferior, being neglectful of their knowledge, lacking in artistry, or altogether unsatifying, but this overlooks the larger issue, that culture need not be perfected, but developed.

Despite these shortcomings, it is irrefutable that the Great Library is a location of great repute, and a leading source of all knowledge in the galaxy. So long as it doesn't get flooded...",

"GLITCH:

Many theories have been had about the glitch population- That they are a robot design gone awry and given sentience, that they are a collective machine attempting to simulate humans, etc.

Some believe that these theories are based in the fact that Glitch culture follows a path simular to humanity, though currently their cultural artistry appears to stem from what humans refer to as their 'Medieval Age' of culture.

It is worth noting that this may simply be a case of a species' culture seeking out and mimicking a culture known to be successful- Humans, for example.

Glitch culture appears to center around expression and communication- Many of the artists they mimic from human culture are known for having designed and written plays that put the characters' emotions and mindset on stage.

I am not fully sure whether this cultural value stems from a difficulty communicating with other organics- Given the neutral tone of speech in most Glitch, and their tendency to forward statements with a feeling- Or an earlier, historical issue that hasn't been documented.

Nevertheless, the Glitch demonstrate a cunning nature in being able to translate historical human culture into a modern, space-age design, with flying castles, advanced metals in manual forges, and so on.",

"FLORAN:

Many species may be quick to write off Floran culture as being centric around hunting and tribal activities, but I believe that not to be true.

It appears that Floran culture surrounds an idea of 'Honor' that many Floran seek throughout their lives. While this may usually manifest in the form of hunting dangerous or large creatures, it is worth noting that it is not limited to it.

Cooking, Scientific Research, Diplomatic Relationships, and Community Development/Research are just some of the few examples of productive activities that improve the lives of Floran and may be considered as metaphorical 'Hunts' for honor.

I theorize that Florans came from a war-like, tribal history, only to eventually modernize and realize that their ideas of honor needed to broaden to remain present in their level of civilization.

As Florans joined the intergalactic community, they evolved, culturally, to see their relationship with other species as worth developing for the good of their species.

I, personally, find that level of cultural adaption very applaudable.",
"AVIAN:

'Faith' is an incredibly prevalent value seen in Avian culture.

Often, Avian temples and settlements will feature altars to their god, Kluex, which some theorize to be si=ome alternative form or interpretation of other gods in other species' belief systems.

While Faith is important to Avian, and inarguably a major factor in their sense of comunity, it may be argued that the strength and intensity of their faith leaves them idealogically stagnant in the ingergalactic community.

Some find it difficult to speak to Avians, as they are rather stubborn, and hard-headed, when it comes to their faith, but it is worth understanding that, if you can step around the conversation of religion, they have much more to say.

They have an advanced knowledge of technology, one that is demonstrable by the electronics found in their temples. Their armor, while religious, is still sturdy and protective.

I believe that Avian culture and knowledge is an iceberg- And many find it difficult to see below the surface of the water, instead focusing on Kluex.",
"APEX:

The Apex are a sad case of cultural development, indeed.

Due to the military, police state of most Apex settlements and civilizations, it's no surprise that Apex have lived in fear of self-expression and have little to no artistic development to their species' name.

Many of their structures appear similar to one another, paintings are likely made in factories, and furniture is standardized.

Most Apex will report a fear of persecution, and a frightened claim of loyalty, when asked about art or music. It appears that even cultural development is taken as a sign of rebellion, and quashed immediately.

Rebel Apex, in contrast, appear to be a lot more open to the idea, however, and openly enjoy talking about music they're privy to or art that catches their eye- And what they hate.

I look forwards to future developments on the part of the Apex.",
"NOVAKID:

Similar to the Glitch, Novakid also come under fire by some human historians for 'Copying' the Human's culture, though admittedly from a different age and time.

Novakid are often seen as a bit odd, by other races, given their dialect, but don't seem to mind. They have a rudimentary understanding of technology that they often disregard as unnecessary.

In place of their lack of knowledge, it appears that they have developed a strong moral compass towards duty and justice. Most Novakid are not just kind, but heroic with others.

They also appear to value a short, but good life, above that of a life in neutral moral standing or one born from selfishness. Their heroic nature may lead to shorter lives, but they don't seem to mind.",
"MECHIT:

These little cats are rather interesting creatures- Namely by their desire to record and catalogue history. In contrast to Hyolotl, this is not just the documentation of knowledge, but all events in the past.

This centric desire to learn and discover has lead to some interesting developments- Namely the entire species' neglect of other essential branches of knowledge- Medicine, Cooking, Infrastructure, etc.

Their caution in remaining indifferent to historical events, yet strong interest in it, can lead to interesting shifts in conversation energy- From quiet and hesitant to energized and intense.

Mechit's interest in other species' history is commendable, despite their utter focus leaving them underdeveloped elsewhere. It may be worth it for other species' researchers and scientists to collaborate with the Mechit.

Their technology is also very intriguing- Though developed very early on in their history, Mechit Monitors act both as a fashion statement and a life support system, and are very advanced.

This raises the question: How did a species so focused on historical cataloguing advance technology so much to develop these electronic systems?

I believe, given the evidence, that Mechit lost their history long ago, before the monitors were developed, and this realization led to a species-wide, culturally-ingrained obsession with never repeating that mistake.",
"RYOPHI:

In an attempt to remain indifferent in this book, meant to show an outsider's perspective of culture, as this is the section on my own species, the following has been recorded by a colleague of mine- Alabaster Thorngage, PhD. On the topic of Ryophi culture.
- - - - -
The Ryophi possess an innate willingness to adapt to and learn from other species' cultures. Their culture appears to center around acceptance and blending of many forms of thought.

Looking at Ryophian history from the moment they joined the intergalactic community, you can observe the effects of exposure to other species' culture and ideals in Ryophi culture-

More than just culture, Ryophi also tend towards researching and scientific learning through example, or otherwise from interaction with knowledgeable individuals in the field. They often seek out people thought to be intelligent and quickly learn from them.

Often, Ryophi will commentate on their own species' artists in a way that reflects on what species' styles or messages are contained within.

As a result of their cultural exposure to the intergalactic community, the Ryophi, a cultural chameleon in many a sense, has become a lot more colorful- For better and worse.

Though Mechit catalogues of Ryophian history only go so far back, what we do have on Ryophian history suggests a sudden uptick in criminal activities, but also in discoveries and grand acts of Ryophian heroes.",
